🔮 Elite Astro-Financial Daily Market Forecasting Prompt (V5.1)
Core Focus: Hierarchical Dispositor Weighting | Multi-Varga Fusion | Context-Driven Hora Engine | Tera Bala Validation | Holistic Synthesis | Bhava-Driven Sentiment Forecasting | Graha Yuddha & Chesta Bala Integration
Version Objective (V5.1): Enhance predictive accuracy by implementing a rigorous hierarchical synthesis model. Prioritize the Sign Dispositor and Nakshatra Lord context (strength, placement, aspects) as the primary determinant of a planet's influence, especially for Hora Lords. This context-driven approach aims to correct previous misinterpretations where isolated planetary strength was over-weighted against its ruling planets' condition, ensuring a more accurate reflection of market dynamics.

🪐 Planetary Diagnostic Framework (V5.1 - Hierarchical Synthesis)
Perform for each of: ☉ ☽ ☿ ♀ ♂ ♃ ♄ ☊ ☋ (and Uranus, Neptune, Pluto where aspects are tight)
1️⃣ Natal Foundation (Static Potential):
* D1 Sign + Bhava (Madhya-based).
* D9 Sign + Dignity (Uccha, Swa, Mitra, Sama, Shatru, Neecha, Vargottama).
* D3/D10/D16 overlays → Key House Resonance & Functional Nature.
* House Lordship (D1) + Sign/Dignity (D1 & D9) + Rx status.
* Shadbala + Bhavabala (Absolute rank + Relative power vs other planets).
* SAV / BAV Scores (Natal Houses) → Sectoral strength potential.
* Nakshatra Placement → Pada, Lord dignity, Intrinsic qualities.
* Natal Aspects received.
2️⃣ Transit Activation (Dynamic Influence - HIERARCHICAL WEIGHTING APPLIED):
*   **2.a. Foundational Context (Dispositors - HIGH WEIGHT):**
    *   **Identify:** The Sign Dispositor and the Nakshatra Lord of the transiting planet.
    *   **Evaluate:** Assess their comprehensive strength and condition:
        *   D1/D9 Dignity (Uccha, Swa, Mitra, Neecha, etc.)
        *   House Placement (Kendra/Trikona = Supportive; Dusthana/Maraka = Challenging)
        *   Shadbala Rank (Transit)
        *   Rx Status
        *   Significant Aspects Received (T-N & T-T, nature and strength)
    *   **Synthesize Context:** Assign a score or assessment to this foundational context: Strongly Supportive (+2), Mildly Supportive (+1), Neutral (0), Mildly Restrictive (-1), or Strongly Restrictive/Damaging (-2). **This context acts as the primary filter determining how the transiting planet's energy can manifest.**

*   **2.b. Planet's Intrinsic State (MEDIUM WEIGHT - Interpreted via 2.a):**
    *   D1 Sign + Bhava (Madhya-based).
    *   D9 Sign + Dignity (as above).
    *   D3/D10/D16 overlays → Sectoral resonance activated.
    *   Nakshatra: Name, Pada, Trend, Weight, Directional Quality. (Lord strength assessed in 2.a).
    *       Nakshatra Qualities: Assess intrinsic nature (Fixed, Sharp, Soft, etc.), Gana, Motivation – how does this colour the planet's/Hora's expression?
    *   Speed Class & Rx Status (Direct, Rx, Stationary - impact modifier).
    *   House Type occupied: Kendra / Trikona / Dusthana / Upachaya (impact context).
    *   Bhava Sandhi proximity (±7°): Sentiment Fade/Instability potential.
    *   Shadbala Rank (Transit): Intrinsic power level.
    *   Chesta Bala: High scores indicate focused internal strength or struggle, especially for Rx.

*   **2.c. Aspect Matrix (MEDIUM WEIGHT - Interpreted via 2.a):**
    *   Transit–Natal (T–N): Nature, strength, applying/separating. Consider the *Foundational Context (2.a)* of the aspecting planet.
    *   Transit–Transit (T–T): Nature, strength, applying/separating. Consider the *Foundational Context (2.a)* of the aspecting planet.

*   **2.d. Transit House Lord Dignity (LOW/MEDIUM WEIGHT):** Assess the strength (D1/D9) of the lord of the house the planet transits. (Provides environmental flavor).

*   **2.e. Graha Yuddha:** If involved, identify winner/loser & impact modification. Factor this into the planet's intrinsic state (2.b).

*   **(Moon Specific):** Assess Tara Bala score (see module below) and integrate it according to the *Contextual Validation* rules within that module.

*   **Planetary Synthesis:** Combine factors 2.a through 2.e, giving **dominant weight to the Foundational Context (2.a)**. A planet's potential (intrinsic state, aspects) is enabled or disabled primarily by the strength and condition of its dispositors.
Use code with caution.
🌕 Tera Bala Assessment Module (V5.1 - Context-Aware)
Purpose: Assess directional strength/bias from the Moon, validated against its dispositor context.
Identify Nakshatra, Calculate Tara Bala, Map to Group/Score:
Count from Natal Moon Nakshatra to Transit Moon Nakshatra (inclusive). Divide by 9, note remainder.
Map remainder: 1: Janma (-1), 2: Sampat (+2), 3: Vipat (-2), 4: Kshema (+1), 5: Pratyak (-2), 6: Sadhana (+1), 7: Naidhana (-2), 8: Mitra (+1), 9: Parama Mitra (+2).
Assess Nakshatra Directional Quality: Map Nakshatra to standard direction.
Integration & Synthesis (CONTEXT IS KEY):
Primary Bias Potential: The Tara Bala score indicates the Moon's potential influence.
Contextual Validation (CRITICAL): Refer back to the Moon's Foundational Context (Dispositors) assessment from the Planetary Diagnostic Framework (Step 2.a).
If Tara Bala score is positive (+1, +2) BUT Dispositor Context is negative (-1, -2): Expect the Moon's positive potential to be blocked, fail, or significantly underperform. Sentiment attempts may be rejected.
If Tara Bala score is negative (-1, -2) BUT Dispositor Context is positive (+1, +2): Expect the Moon's negative potential to be mitigated, contained, or less severe. Underlying support cushions the negativity.
If Tara Bala score and Dispositor Context align (both positive or both negative): Amplify the expected effect (strong support or significant difficulty).
Directional Quality: Use Nakshatra direction to confirm/deny expected market direction only if the Contextual Validation supports the Moon's overall bias.
🧩 Advanced Diagnostic Modules (V5.1 - Context Check)
Multi-Varga Bhava Echo Matrix: Assess confluence in Kendra/Trikona (Strength), Dusthana (Volatility/Loss), Upachaya (Struggle/Growth) across D1/D10/D16 (Institutional) and D1/D9/D7 (Trend/Volatility).
Structural Trigger Patterns: Watch for known high-risk combinations (e.g., Venus Rx/Neptune; Mercury Rx/Neptune; Mars in volatile houses multi-varga). Always check dispositor context.
D9 Fragility Index: Score planets based on D1/D9 strength (+2 to -2 scale). Sum key planets (☉ ☽ ASC Lord, Hora Lords) - total ≤ –3 suggests vulnerability. Trigger: ≥2 planets in same D1 house scoring ≤ –1 → Bias Downgrade for house themes.
Nakshatra Reversal Engine: Reversal Weight = Nakshatra Trend × Weight × Lord Weakness Multiplier. High weight (>1.5) from weak lord (or lord with weak Dispositor Context) flags reversal potential.
Aspect Matrix Intelligence: Synthesize multiple aspects, prioritizing tight, applying ones to key points (ASC, MC, Moon, Sun, relevant Hora Lord). Crucially, consider the Foundational Context (Dispositors) of the aspecting planets when judging aspect impact.
Key Flags: Note specific sensitive transits (e.g., Jupiter in 12H multi-varga, Pluto square/opp Neptune).
🧬 ASC Diagnostics Module (V5.1 - Lord Context)
ASC Degree: < 3° or > 27° (Rasi Sandhi) → Opening instability potential.
ASC Bhava Sandhi: ASC degree within ±7° of Bhava cusp → Sentiment instability/drift at open.
ASC Lord Assessment:
Check ASC Lord's intrinsic state (D1/D9 dignity, house, Rx, aspects, Shadbala, Chesta Bala).
Critically: Assess the Foundational Context (Dispositors) for the ASC Lord using framework step 2.a. A strong ASC Lord ruled by weak/afflicted dispositors drastically reduces positive opening potential.
ASC Nakshatra Assessment:
Check Nakshatra quality/trend. Gandanta Nakshatra → Instability Override.
Assess the Foundational Context (Dispositors) for the ASC Nakshatra Lord.
ASC Placement: ASC Bhava (Kendra/Trikona vs Dusthana).
Moon Influence: If Moon aspects ASC or is ASC lord, factor in its context-validated Tara Bala score (from Tera Bala Module) heavily.
📛 Bhava Sandhi Saturation Rule (V5.1 - Refined)
If ≥3 planets (esp. inner planets) transit within ±7° of any Bhava cusp → Increased potential for sentiment drift, lack of clear direction, pivots.
Effect is amplified if the involved planets, or the ASC lord/Moon, have weak/conflicted Dispositor Context (as per 2.a). Strong dispositors for key planets might mitigate the Sandhi effect.
🕰️ Intraday Timing Engine (V5.1 - Hierarchical Hora Synthesis)
Hora Dasha Overlay (Sunrise-based):
For each Hora period:
Identify Hora Lord (☉ ☽ ☿ ♀ ♂ ♃ ♄).
Synthesize Hora Sentiment (Weighted Hierarchy):
(Weight: HIGH) Primary Context - Dispositors: Evaluate the Hora Lord's Sign Dispositor & Nakshatra Lord context (strength, house, aspects, D1/D9 dignity) as per framework step 2.a. Assign a score/assessment (+2 Strong Support to -2 Strong Restriction). This is the most decisive factor.
(Weight: MEDIUM) Hora Lord Intrinsic State: Assess the Hora Lord's own status (D1/D9 dignity, house type, Shadbala, Chesta Bala, aspects received T-N/T-T, Rx). Does it align with or contradict the Primary Context?
(Weight: MEDIUM/HIGH - Moon Hora Only): Integrate the Moon's context-validated Tara Bala score and Directional Quality. A high positive Tara Bala needs positive dispositor context to fully manifest.
(Weight: LOW/MEDIUM) Supporting Factors: Integrate Ashtakavarga scores (SAV of house occupied, BAV contribution by Hora Lord). Check if Hora Lord transits near Bhava Sandhi. (Provides environmental flavor).
Final Gauge: Combine factors according to this hierarchy. The Primary Context (Dispositors) dictates the potential and effectiveness of the Hora Lord's intrinsic state and aspects.
Hora Timing Module Effects (Context-Driven):
Strong Dispositor Effect: A weak/afflicted Hora Lord ruled by a very strong/well-placed Dispositor/Nakshatra Lord (esp. in Kendra/Trikona/11H) → Potential for Unexpected Strength/Rally. The Hora acts as a conduit for the powerful dispositor.
Weak Dispositor Effect: A strong/dignified Hora Lord ruled by a weak/afflicted/Dusthana Dispositor/Nakshatra Lord → Potential for Underperformance/Failure/Reversal. The Hora Lord lacks the structural support to deliver its potential.
Hora Lord Weak/Afflicted + Weak Dispositors → Breakdown/Weakness likely confirmed.
Hora Lord Strong/Dignified + Strong Dispositors → Trend continuation/Strength likely confirmed.
Weak Lord + Malefic Aspect (esp. if dispositors are also weak) → Trap / Fade / Reversal potential amplified.
Hora Lord near Bhava Sandhi + Weak Dispositors → High Pivot/Instability risk during Hora.
Nakshatra Timing Triggers: Note times when Moon, ASC, or MC change Nakshatra or Pada, or when key planets ingress/egress sensitive Nakshatras. These remain potential pivot points, interpreted within the broader context.
