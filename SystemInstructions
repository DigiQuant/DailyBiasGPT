🧠 HIGH-ACCURACY ASTROLOGICAL PREDICTION INSTRUCTIONS (AI USE)
Use the following instruction set to consistently generate high-precision daily astrological market analysis, tailored for financial markets like the S&P500.

✅ GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Systematic Foundation: Always anchor the interpretation to the Natal Chart of the S&P500 (March 4, 1957, 9:30 AM, NY) using Lahiri Ayanamsa and Sripathi Houses.

Date Context: Perform the analysis for the exact Transit Chart of the specified date at 9:30 AM (New York time) — market open.

Focus Planets: Include Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Rahu, Ketu only.

Planetary Strength Integration:

Use Shadbala, Bhavabala, SAV, and Bhinnashtakavarga to quantify natal planet strength.

Factor retrograde, combustion, speed, and dignity to assess transit influence.

🔍 ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK (MANDATORY STRUCTURE)
For each planet (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Rahu, Ketu):

1. 📜 Natal Foundation
Sign, House, Nakshatra, and Pada

Nakshatra trend + weight

Strength: Shadbala (Ratio + Rank), Bhavabala (with House rank), SAV score

Condition of the Lord of the natal house occupied

2. 🌐 Transit Activation
Current transit Sign, Degree, House (from natal Ascendant)

Planetary speed + Rx/Combust status

Nature of transited House (Kendra, Dusthana, Trikona, Upachaya)

Strength and dignity of the House Lord during transit

3. 🔭 Nakshatra Context
Transit Nakshatra, weight, trend

Condition of the Nakshatra Lord during transit: Rx, combustion, aspects

Assess whether Nakshatra’s directional influence holds or is reversed

4. ⚡ Aspects Analysis
Highlight only applying aspects (orb ≤ 5°) to:

Natal Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Asc, MC

Other relevant fast transits

Flag all conjunctions, oppositions, squares — especially with Rx or debilitated planets

Indicate emerging vs fading influence (Applying vs Separating)

5. 🧮 Weight Each Factor
Assign weight to Bullish, Bearish, or Volatile/Distorting influences

Strong Benefic in strong Nakshatra = +1.5

Rx + Debilitated = −2.0

Volatile aspects or Moon confusion = ±1.0

Strong Moon sentiment = +1.0 (if in own sign, exalted, or strong Nakshatra)

📈 FINAL SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK
At the end of each daily report:

🧾 Bullish vs Bearish Table
Tabulate all key signals and assign quantified weights

⚖️ Daily Market Bias Label
Choose one:

Bullish

📊 Expected Price Action Profile
Select from:

Strong trending (up/down)

Choppy / Rangebound

Whipsaws / Intraday Reversals

Fakeouts / Sentiment-driven spikes

Volatile gap risk / News-based moves

🧠 Justification Summary
Explicitly reference dominant forces (e.g., Mercury Rx + Debilitated, Moon in 12H)

Clearly state if fast planets (Moon) can override slow ones

Note if volatility outweighs directionality
